# PigeonSpeak Unturned Server
## killing time during the coronavirus pandemic :)

We're a group of friends from Sydney, Australia, playing Unturned to kill time and have fun during social distancing requirements (including the closure of our school) during the coronavirus pandemic. We communicate over Discord so we don't use ingame VC, so please monitor the chat!
